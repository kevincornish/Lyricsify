Lyricsify is a Python application that uses the [Genius API](https://genius.com/developers) to search for and display song lyrics. It features a simple graphical user interface built with Tkinter and styled with the Spotify color scheme.

## Installation

To run Lyricsify, you'll need Python 3 and the `lyricsgenius` package installed. You can install `lyricsgenius` using pip:

```
pip install lyricsgenius
```

## Usage

To use Lyricsify, simply run the `lyricsify.py` script in a terminal or command prompt. The graphical user interface will appear, prompting you to enter the name of a song. Once you click the "Search" button, Lyricsify will search for the lyrics to that song using the Genius API and display them in the text box.
